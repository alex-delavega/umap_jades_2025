# umap_jades_2025
Python code to reproduce Figures 2 through 4 in de la Vega et al. (2025). This work searched for quiescent galaxies over 3 < z < 6 in the publicly available JWST dataset JADES using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning algorithm (UMAP, McInnes et al. 2018). This repository contains a jupyter notebook (umap_jades_2025.ipynb) that can be used to reproduce Figures 2 through 4, which involve training the UMAP algorithm on a mock dataset (JAGUAR, Williams et al. 2018), selecting a parent sample of galaxies, projecting the parent sample onto the UMAP visualization, and pre-selecting candidate pools that contain high-redshift quiescent galaxies.
